Fixed double free error, not 100% sure if printing colors correctly, requires more testing

Fixed the error in which the screen did not print the desired color to the entire screen. Works on school machines now.

Updated networking files. To do stuff:
- for some reason headers.h isn't working correctly and there is a compile error when trying to do make client
- not sure if the way I did color send/receive is correct

graceC -- 2018-01-13 20:01
basic scrolling text!

naotakaK -- 2018-01-18 17:24
pseudocode for whack-a-mole,
should be able to scale to scrolling text fairly easily

Completely rewrote forking_server.c, working version is at server_test.c.
 - the new version now uses pipes to communicate from the main server to the subservers per DW's suggestions
 - no longer requires any shared memory
 - this works with multiple clients
 - changing colors is done by sending data through pipes from main server to all or select subservers
 - game initialization works (all clients turn red, then one client turns blue)
 - the problem is that the main server isn't reading from the pipes (I think)
 - after initialization, the main server doesn't do anything and pressing enter on clients does nothing
 - added comments for everything
 - problem areas are commented with /*** ***/
 - minor edit to color_client.c to make it write "" instead of "\n" if nothing is reading from STDIN
TODO:
 - obviously fix server_test.c
 - make it work with actual IPs (should be fine)
 - memory matrix?? scrolling text??
 - clean up headers.h
 - clean up makefile
 - clean up output for main server to create game experience
 - update README - are we doing one server file only?
