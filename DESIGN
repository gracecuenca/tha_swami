Team Tha Swami: Jack Cruse, Grace Cuenca and Naotaka Kinoshita

Description: Mini Arcade with Whack-a-mole / Memory Matrix (MVP), Tetris if time

User Interface: The terminal

Technical Design:
Topics covered in class:
- networking to connect to multiple computers
- processes (ex. forking) to pass repeated child processes to other computers
- files because sockets are files
- signals to end/start processes on all connected computers

Project Breakdown:
- Phase I: Whack-a-mole Phase
  - adding this game is our project at its most basic state
- Phase II: Scrolling Text
  - after implementing whack-a-mole, sending text through connected computers should come naturally
- Phase III: Memory Matrix
  - Connected computers randomly change color and user must press them in order
- Phase IV: Tetris

Data Structures:
- home-made structs for sending information

Algorithms:
- random number generator

Timeline:
- 12/27-29: Finalize design and team roles
- 1/5: Basic program for changing colors in terminal (without networking)
- 1/12: Implement scrolling text (without networking)
- 1/19: Implement networking on phases I and II, if time, begin working on phase III.
- 1/26: Finish networking and phase III if possible. If phase III is completed by this time, try to do phase IV (highly unlikely)
